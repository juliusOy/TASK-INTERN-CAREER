## Introduction

This project aims to analyze Spotify track data to uncover trends and patterns in track popularity, explicit content, duration, mode, key, and other attributes over time. By leveraging MySQL for data storage and retrieval and Python for visualization, we create a robust analytical pipeline for exploring and analyzing the data.

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of two tables: `track_detail` and `track_figures`. The `track_detail` table contains details about each track, including ID, name, artists, duration, release date, and year. The `track_figures` table contains numerical figures related to each track, such as acousticness, danceability, energy, popularity, and explicitness.

## Datasets

Two datasets are used in this project: `track_detail.csv` and `track_figures.csv`. These datasets contain information about individual tracks, including their attributes and figures.

## Data Exploration

Various SQL queries are employed to explore the data, including identifying tables in the database, checking for missing values, duplicates, anomalies, and performing basic queries such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY.

## Trend Analysis

Trend analysis queries are executed to analyze trends in track popularity, explicit content, duration, mode, and key over the years. These queries provide insights into how certain attributes evolve over time and their impact on track popularity.

## Visualization

Python is utilized for visualization purposes, leveraging libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to create insightful charts, graphs, and plots based on the analyzed data. Visualizations enhance the understanding of trends and patterns discovered during the analysis phase.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or explore the data further, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a MySQL database and import the provided datasets (`track_detail.csv` and `track_figures.csv`).
3. Execute the SQL queries provided in the project to create the database schema, perform data exploration, and conduct trend analysis.
4. Utilize Python scripts to visualize the analyzed data and gain deeper insights into Spotify track trends.
